# Level-Design-Lara Croft Go

Level Design Project: The Amphibian Abyss

A swamp-themed level design project focused on environmental storytelling, traversal mechanics, and enemy AI integration. Players navigate a decaying, poison-filled ruin to retrieve the King Crown, overcoming hazards like:
Dynamic Terrain: Unstable platforms, collapsing pathways, and hidden traps.
Toxic Guardians: Agile poison frogs with area-denial attacks and ambush behavior.

Built in Unity as a modular level design demo. Contributions and feedback welcome!
